Plan to solve the problem

-The HTML file contains multiple resume samples with details like name, career objectives, technical skills, education, and experience.

-The content is organized using various HTML tags such as <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <ul>, <li>, <b>, etc.

-Add an input field where users can type the text they want to search for.

-Add a button to trigger the search when clicked.

-Write a function that captures the text from the input field.

-Use document.querySelectorAll or document.getElementsByTagName to search through specific HTML elements such as <h2>, <h3>, and <p>.

-Loop through these elements to find matching content using the .includes() method for partial text matching or .toLowerCase() for case-insensitive searching.

-If a match is found, highlight the matched text by wrapping it in a <span> element with a background color (e.g., yellow).

-Update the HTML content dynamically to reflect the highlighted text.

-If matching content is found, scroll to the element or update the user interface with a notification.

-If no matches are found, display an appropriate message to the user ("No matches found").

-Implement a "clear search" feature to reset the highlighted text.
